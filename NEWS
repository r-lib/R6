R6 2.0.1.9xxx
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added support for making shallow clones of R6 objects with the `clone()`
  function. (#27)

* Allow adding public or private members when there were no public or private
  members to begin with. (#51)

* Previously, when an R6 object was printed, it accessed (and called) active
  bindings. Now it simply reports that a field is an active binding. (#37, #38.
  Thanks to Oscar de Lama)

* Printing private members now works correctly for portable R6 objects. (#26)

* The 'lock' argument has been renamed to 'lock_objects'. Also, there is a new
  argument, 'lock_class', which can prevent changes to the class. (#52)

R6 2.0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* A superclass is validated on object instantation, not on class creation.

* Added `debug` and `undebug` methods to generator object.

R6 2.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [BREAKING CHANGE] Added `portable` option, which allows inheritance across
  different package namespaces, and made it the default.

* Added `set()` method on class generator object, so new fields and methods can
  be added after the generator has been created.

* All of the functions involved in instantiating objects are encapsulated in
  an environment separate from the R6 namespace. This means that if a
  generator is created with one version of R6, saved, then restored in a new R
  session that has a different version of R6, there shouldn't be any problems
  with compatibility.

* Methods are locked so that they can't be changed. (Fixes #19)

* Inheritance of superclasses is dynamic; instead of reading in the superclass
  when a class is created, this happens each time an object is instantiated.
  (Fixes #12)

* Added trailing newline when printing R6 objects. (Thanks to Gabor Csardi)

* The `print` method of R6 objects can be redefined. (Thanks to Gabor Csardi)
